      <li class="has-alert"><span class="agreement-section-header">Repairs and maintenance:</span> It’s our job to coordinate repairs and maintenance. We’ll employ and supervise all labor needed to keep the property in good shape. We’ll take charge of repairs, decorating, and alterations, including buying any supplies needed.

          <div class="agreement-alert-text">
            <p>If we make a reasonable attempt to get your authorization, but you’re not around, we may spend more than $350 if we think that expense is necessary for the protection of the property from damage. We can also spend more than $350 for tenant services provided for in their leases.</p>

      <li class="has-alert"><span class="agreement-section-header">Hold harmless:</span> You agree to hold harmless from all damages or suits in connection with the management of the property described above, and from liability for injury suffered by any employee or other person whomsoever, and to carry, at his own expense, adequate public liability insurance and to name the Company as co-insured.
        <div class="agreement-spacer"></div>
